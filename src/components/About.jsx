                <p className="mb-5 text-base-content ">As a self-taught frontend developer, I have spent the past year passionately learning and perfecting my skills. My background in teaching and creating courses brings a unique perspective to my projects, and I am always striving to make my sites engaging and user-friendly. 
                <br/><br/>
                I am now seeking a role as a web developer where I can continue to learn and contribute to meaningful projects in an exciting and dynamic environment. I am dedicated to constantly developing my skills and believe I would make a valuable addition to any team.
                <br/><br/>
                Living in Japan for the past 10 years has given me a deep appreciation for the culture and love for the country. When I'm not coding, I enjoy pushing myself physically by running marathons and hiking the beautiful mountains of Japan, including the 'hyakumeizan'.
